-In Image if we use src="heeps://..." in images , we need to configure what kind of host domains are allowed in next.config
-use tailwind and heroicons together


-use .env.local for storing environment variables locally
-need to restartr the server everytime you updated env
- fetch them with process.env.ENVNAME_ENV

-wrap the app component with provider in order to have a persistant login state (Just like redux)

-use server side rendering for fetching login state
-pass context in get session where context is the request from the user


-in css layout="fill" is dangerous without having the parent element position relative
